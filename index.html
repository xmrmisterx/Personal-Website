<!-- We need to get 2 more status updates (for the mountain description and mountain image), then put them into the HW3 template. We still
need to send our sample csv picture to this terminal from the home computer so we can show that our download button works on the download
page. Then...
-write descriptions for each mountain [done]
-get web scraper working to scrape the image
-make a video and upload video url
-commit code to our github and upload screenshot of commit
-create a release and upload screenshot of release -->

<!-- Alright, so for now, let's first see if we can get the code a scrapeimage function to work with just a string input on a js file
here, then we'll look at how to "create an api" so that ppl can call our function-->
<!-- For transerring the pic of the csv table into this file, maybe we can just create a new github repo and put the image inside of 
it and clone the repository into this flip server?-->

<!--// Ok, so it seems everything is working now. We need to move our pic to the download page, so let's do that. Ok, so we've moved 
// everything into the public html folder, gave it access, turned on our forever server. Now, we just need to:

// c) make video
// d) commit code to github and get screenshot
// e) create a release and get screenshot-->
